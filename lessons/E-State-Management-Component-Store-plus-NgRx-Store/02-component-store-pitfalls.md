# Lesson 2: Component Store Pitfalls

NgRx Component Store is a powerful tool, but like any tool, it can be misused. Understanding common pitfalls will help you write more robust, predictable, and bug-free state management logic.

This lesson covers three common pitfalls: stale snapshots, racing effects, and nested mutations.

## Pitfall 1: Stale Snapshots (Imperative vs. Reactive)

A "stale snapshot" occurs when you read the store's state imperatively at a single point in time, assuming it's the most current version. This can lead to bugs where your logic is acting on outdated information.

-   **The Problem:** Using `this.get()` to fetch the current state value. While `get()` has its uses (e.g., in guards or resolvers), it's dangerous inside component logic because it's not reactive.

**BAD - Stale Snapshot:**
```typescript
// in a component method
onAddItem(newItem: string) {
  const currentState = this.store.get(); // Gets the state *right now*
  if (currentState.items.includes(newItem)) {
    // RACE CONDITION: Another operation could have added this item
    // right after we called .get(), but before we check. This code
    // would then add a duplicate.
    return;
  }
  this.store.addItem(newItem);
}
```

-   **The Solution:** Always use selectors (`this.select()`) for reading state and base your logic on reactive streams. This ensures your logic always has the most up-to-date information.

**GOOD - Reactive Logic:**
You can handle this logic inside an `effect` in your store, which is the preferred way.

```typescript
// in your component store
readonly addItem = this.effect((item$: Observable<string>) => {
  return item$.pipe(
    // Use withLatestFrom to get the latest state from a selector
    withLatestFrom(this.items$),
    filter(([newItem, existingItems]) => !existingItems.includes(newItem)),
    tap(([newItem]) => {
      // The updater now only runs if the item is not a duplicate.
      this.updater(state => ({ ...state, items: [...state.items, newItem] }))();
    })
  );
});
```
By using a selector with `withLatestFrom`, you guarantee you are always checking against the most recent state at the moment the effect runs.

## Pitfall 2: Racing Effects

A race condition in an effect occurs when an effect is triggered multiple times in quick succession, and the operations (e.g., HTTP requests) complete in an unpredictable order.

-   **The Problem:** Using the wrong flattening operator in an effect. `mergeMap` is a common culprit here. If a user clicks a "save" button twice, `mergeMap` will fire two parallel save requests, which could lead to data corruption.

**BAD - Race Condition with `mergeMap`:**
```typescript
// in your component store
readonly saveItem = this.effect((item$: Observable<Item>) => {
  return item$.pipe(
    // If triggered twice, two save requests run in parallel.
    // The second one might finish before the first!
    mergeMap(item => this.apiService.save(item).pipe(/* ... */))
  );
});
```

-   **The Solution:** Choose the right concurrency operator for the job. The same principles from the "Concurrency Semantics" lesson apply directly to Component Store effects.
    -   `concatMap`: Queues the operations. Guarantees order. Good for saves, updates, deletes.
    -   `switchMap`: Cancels the previous operation. Good for search-as-you-type.
    -   `exhaustMap`: Ignores new triggers while an operation is in flight. Excellent for preventing double-clicks on submit buttons.

**GOOD - `exhaustMap` to prevent double-submits:**
```typescript
// in your component store
readonly saveItem = this.effect((item$: Observable<Item>) => {
  return item$.pipe(
    // Ignores subsequent triggers until the save is complete.
    exhaustMap(item => this.apiService.save(item).pipe(
      tapResponse(
        (response) => this.setSaveSuccess(response),
        (error) => this.setSaveError(error)
      )
    ))
  );
});
```

## Pitfall 3: Nested Mutations

State in NgRx (both global and Component Store) should be treated as immutable. Directly mutating a nested object or array within your state is a common bug that can break change detection and lead to an unpredictable UI.

-   **The Problem:** Using methods like `.push()` on an array in the state or directly setting a property on a nested object.

**BAD - Direct Mutation:**
```typescript
// in an updater
this.updater(state => {
  // THIS IS BAD! It mutates the existing state.
  state.config.userPreferences.push('new-preference');
  return state;
})
```

-   **The Solution:** Always return a *new* state object, creating new copies of any nested objects or arrays that you are changing. The spread operator (`...`) is your best friend here.

**GOOD - Immutable Update:**
```typescript
// in an updater
this.updater(state => ({
  ...state, // Copy top-level properties
  config: {
    ...state.config, // Copy nested config properties
    userPreferences: [
      ...state.config.userPreferences, // Copy existing preferences
      'new-preference' // Add the new one
    ]
  }
}))
```
For deeply nested state, this can become verbose. Libraries like `immer` (or `ngrx-immer`) can simplify this process, but understanding the manual spread-operator pattern is fundamental.

## âœ… Verifiable Outcome

You can verify your understanding of these pitfalls by creating tests or small UI experiments to observe the incorrect and correct behaviors.

1.  **Test for Racing Effects:**
    -   Create a Component Store with a `saveItem` effect. Use `mergeMap` and a mock API service with a 1-second delay.
    -   Create a component with a "Save" button that calls `store.saveItem()`.
    -   Run the application and click the "Save" button twice in quick succession.
    -   **Expected (Bad) Result:** You will see two parallel API requests fired in the "Network" tab of your DevTools.
    -   Now, change the operator in the effect from `mergeMap` to `exhaustMap`.
    -   Run the test again, clicking the button twice quickly.
    -   **Expected (Good) Result:** You will see only **one** API request in the Network tab. The second click was ignored, preventing the race condition.

2.  **Test for Nested Mutations:**
    -   Create a store with a state that has a nested array: `myState = { config: { values: ['a', 'b'] } }`.
    -   Create an updater that uses the **BAD** mutation pattern (`state.config.values.push('c')`).
    -   Create a component that displays the length of the `values` array using a selector: `valuesLength$ = this.select(state => state.config.values.length)`.
    -   Add a button to trigger the bad updater.
    -   **Expected (Bad) Result:** When you click the button, the UI will likely **not** update to show the new length. Because you mutated the state in place, NgRx's memoized selectors won't detect a change and the view will become stale.
    -   Now, fix the updater to use the **GOOD** immutable pattern (`...` spread operator).
    -   **Expected (Good) Result:** When you click the button, the UI will now correctly update to show the new length, as a new state object has been created.
