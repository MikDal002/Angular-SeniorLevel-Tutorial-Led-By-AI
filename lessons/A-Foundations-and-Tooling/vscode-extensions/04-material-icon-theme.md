# VS Code Extension: Material Icon Theme

While not a code-editing tool, the Material Icon Theme extension provides a significant quality-of-life improvement by making your project's file structure much easier to navigate visually.

## Why It's Useful

-   **Visual Recognition:** It replaces the default file and folder icons with a rich set of icons from the Material Design icon set. This allows you to instantly recognize common file types at a glance.
-   **Angular-Specific Icons:** The theme has excellent support for Angular projects. It provides specific icons for components, services, modules, routing files, spec files, and more. This helps you quickly identify the purpose of a file without even reading its name.
-   **Improved Navigation:** By making the file tree more visually distinct, it reduces the cognitive load required to find the file you're looking for, speeding up your development workflow.

## Mini-Tutorial

1.  **Install the extension** from the VS Code Marketplace.
2.  **Activate the Icon Theme:**
    -   When you install the extension, VS Code will likely prompt you to activate it. If not, you can do it manually.
    -   Open the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`).
    -   Type "File Icon Theme" and press Enter.
    -   Select "Material Icon Theme" from the list.
3.  **Observe the File Explorer:**
    -   Look at the file explorer pane in VS Code.
    -   **Expected Result:** The icons next to your files and folders should have changed. You will see specific icons for `package.json`, `angular.json`, and folders like `src` and `app`. Inside your `app` folder, you will see unique icons for `app.component.ts`, `app.component.html`, `app.component.css`, and `app.component.spec.ts`, making it immediately clear which file serves which purpose.
